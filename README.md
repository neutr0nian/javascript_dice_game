# javascript_dice_game
A simple JavaScript game mini project.

Pretty straighforward, this project evaluates the basic javascript DOM manipulation.
2 dices are present one for player 1 and another for player 2.
On refreshing the page the dice are changed i.e. the numbers get changed.
Based on the higher number acheived the winner is selected and displayed with the help of DOM manipulation.

Images folder contains the images of dices.
Just download the files and run on your local machine.

Thank you!
